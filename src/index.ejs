        <h1>Human Interest 401(k) Verifier</h1>
        <p>This tool helps you perform some basic sanity checks on how Human Interest reinvested
        your 401(k) funds after your company migrated from another 401(k) provider:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>For each fund reinvested, Shares × Price = Amount</li>
          <li>Reinvested funds were purchased at the correct price for that date</li>
          <li>Funds were allocated according to user's selected allocation</li>
          <li>Add up total amount reinvested</li>
        </ol>

          doing this until you see a yellow tab labeled <strong>Plan Conversion</strong>, followed
          by this text: <em>Assets from a previous provider totalling $_____  were
          reinvested.</em></li>
          <li>Click the <strong>⌄</strong> symbol to expand the Plan Conversion</li>

        <p>At each step of development, this tool's developer prioritized the privacy of the user.
        None of your data is logged or persisted.</p>
        <p>Also note that when you select all text on the Human Interest site, your name is not
        included in the selected text, so it is never pasted into this tool.</p>
